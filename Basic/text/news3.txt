Historians constantly reinterpret historical processes and recreate life-stories of personalities. This requires easy access to new and existing source materials. Documentation exercises — especially when undertaken by historians themselves — facilitate the task of historians. Mushirul Hasan’s project of publishing ‘authentic version’ of the proceedings of the sessions of Indian National Congress between 1885 and 1947 is poised to provide new insights to the trajectory of an organisation that was the largest anti-colonial body of its time. The present volume — covering the five initial sessions from 1885 to 1889 — is the first in the series. Proceedings of each session contain the organisers’ introductory article, summary of resolutions adopted, detailed report of the meet and list of delegates. Extracts of press comments on the first three sessions — annexed to the proceedings of those sessions — offer contemporary responses to India’s new national political experiment.

Hasan’s introductory essay appropriately convinces the importance of the volume for a relook at the first years of the Congress in the context of current historiography of Indian nationalism. The early Congress was not a ‘full-fledged political party’. It had neither paying members nor a central office, nor a permanent fund, nor permanent officials. All it had was a general secretary. The leaders spared no efforts to assure the Raj that the Congress “wasn’t a nursery for sedition and rebellion.” They, as Jawaharlal Nehru admitted, remained preoccupied with concerns of landlords, capitalists and educated unemployed. Yet, the proceedings of its first five sessions indicate a general will of the Congress to present an all-India front to the colonial regime. The number of delegates, representing the country’s four corners, rose from 72 in 1885 at Bombay, to 436 in 1886 at Calcutta, 607 in 1887 at Madras, 1,248 in 1888 at Allahabad and to 1,889 in Bombay.
