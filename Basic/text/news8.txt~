 Chief Minister and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) general secretary Jayalalithaa has announced a massive demonstration in front of Central Government offices in district headquarters on Thursday (January 24), condemning the Centre and a key constituent of the United Progressive Alliance government, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).

According to a release of the party, the demonstrations will be organised by the Anna Thozhirsanga Peravai, the partyâ€™s labour wing, condemning the Centre for eroding the federal principles and snatching away the rights of the State.

Detailing the reasons for organising the demonstrations, she said the Centre had failed to notify the final verdict of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal despite repeated pleas of the State.

It did not bother to address the acute power shortage in the State by denying the surplus available with it and not coming forward to allocate to Tamil Nadu power produced by the Central generating stations.
