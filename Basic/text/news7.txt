National president of the Janata Dal (Secular) H.D. Deve Gowda has claimed that his party was ready to support the Congress for moving a no-confidence motion against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the State. However, the Congress had not evinced any interest in this regard.

“When I offered to support the no-confidence motion to the Congress, the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president G. Parameshwara said that the Congress does not need the guidance of Mr. Deve Gowda. What can the JD (S) do if the Principal Opposition party has no interest in moving a no-confidence motion against the government”, he said.
