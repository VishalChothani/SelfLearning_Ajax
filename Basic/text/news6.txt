 The beheading an Indian solder on the Line of Control and refusal of the Pakistan government to hand over his head, he said, was a national shame.

He said that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was the only alternative for achieving this goal. The actual loss to the Central exchequer in the coal muddle was Rs. 5.5 lakh crore as the centre gave 44 leases of coal mines free.
